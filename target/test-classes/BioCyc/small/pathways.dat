COMMON-NAME - queuosine biosynthesis
CITATIONS - :EV-EXP:3512752052:keseler
COMMENT - |FRAME: CPD-13053 "Queuosine"| is an important |FRAME: 7-Deazapurines 7-deazapurine"|-modified nucleoside that is present in certain tRNAs in bacteria and most eukaryotes (with the exception of mycoplasmas and yeast).  It is not found in the archaea |CITS: [12697167]|.  Prokaryotes can synthesize queuosine <i>de novo</i> by a complex biosynthetic pathway, whereas eukaryotes are unable to synthesize it, and utilize a salvage system, acquiring the |FRAME: QUEUINE| base as a nutrient factor from their diet or from intestinal microflora |CITS: [19925456 ]|.
/
/Queuosine and its derivatives occur exclusively at position 34 (the wobble position) in the anticodons of tRNAs coding for the amino acids |FRAME: HIS|, |FRAME:L-ASPARTATE|, |FRAME: ASN| and |FRAME: TYR| |CITS: [ 4550561]|.  Each of these tRNAs posses the anticodon sequence GUN (positions 34-36), where N can be any nucleotide.  Queuosine improves accuracy of translation |CITS: [2988936][11532950]|.  These tRNAs of the 'Q-family' originally contain guanine in the first position of anticodon, which is post-transcriptionally modified with |FRAME: QUEUINE| by an irreversible insertion during maturation. 
/
/Beside the 7-deazaguanosine core, queuosine possesses an additional adaptation - a cyclopentenediol ring attached to an aminomethyl group at position 7.  The cyclopentendiol ring can be further modified by glutamylation (see |FRAME: EG11362-MONOMER|) |CITS: [16164993]|.
/
/The first part of the pathway leading to formation of queuosine, up to the intermediate |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, is described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6703|. 
/
/|FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE "PreQ<sub>0</sub>"| is a common intermediate, and is also found in the pathways leading to the biosynthesis of several 7-deazapurine antibiotics produced by <i>Streptomyces</i> species.  Before it can be inserted into a tRNA, it is converted into |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-3501|.  This enzyme uses two NADPH molecules to reduce the nitrile group of |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE| to an amino group |CITS: [15767583]|.  The next enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX0-1101|, catalyzes a complex reaction in which |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| is transferred into a target tRNA molecule, replacing the guanine base with the 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine group at position 34 |CITS: [8323579]|.  The enzyme recognizes the anticodon region of its substrate, and only acts on tRNAs that contain a GUN sequence |CITS: [8494901]|.
/
/The next enzyme, |FRAME: EG10812-MONOMER|, transfers a ribose moiety from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| to the 7-aminomethyl group of |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, resulting in the formation of the 2,3-epoxy-4,5-dihydroxycyclopentane ring of epoxyqueuosine and releasing |FRAME: ADENINE| and |FRAME: MET| |CITS: [8347586][7849103]|.  In the last step of the pathway, the eopxy bonds are reduced, generating the final queuosine residue.  The reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: G7843-MONOMER| |CITS: [21502530]|.

COMMENT - tRNAs are the molecular adapters that allow the synthesis of proteins based on mRNAs transcribed from protein-coding genes. The active form of tRNA is generated by a combination of nuclease-based processing, the modification of select nucleosides, and finally charging via the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|.
/
/tRNA processing is a multi-step pathway carried out by a mix of endonucleases and exonucleases. Processing begins with the endonucleolytic cleavage of individual tRNA precursors from RNAs containing multiple tRNAs. This initial cleavage can generate precursor molecules with a long 5' trailing end or with a short 5' extension. Precursors with a long trailer require additional exonucleolytic processing before the other nucleases in the pathway can act.
/
/Following this initial processing step, a suite of ribonucleases cut down the 5' and 3' ends to yield the final, processed tRNA.
/
/Although this processing pathway can function with as a few as one of its constituent exonucleases, the final tRNA product may be "imperfect," with a 3' end that may be longer or shorter than normal.

COMMON-NAME - pyrimidine ribonucleotides interconversion
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts bicarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to the pyrimidine ribonucleotide uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP), as shown in the pathway link to |FRAME: PWY-5686| at the beginning of this pathway.  UMP can subsequently be converted to other pyrimidine ribonucleotides as shown in this pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Uridine-5'-phosphate (UMP) is converted to UDP and then to UTP by two kinase reactions.  The first is a specific kinase encoded by <i>pyrH</i> and the second is a nonspecific kinase encoded by <i>ndk</i>.  CTP is synthesized from UTP in an amination reaction involving CTP synthetase, a glutamine amidotransferase encoded by <i>pyrG</i>.
/
/Uridylate kinase (UMP kinase) controls the <i>de novo</i> synthesis of other pyrimidine nucleotides.  The <i>E. coli</i> enzyme is highly regulated by UTP inhibition and GTP activation. Bacterial UMP kinases are potential targets for drug development due their differing specificity and structure from animal CMP/UMP kinases |CITS: [19071117]|. CTP synthetase is also highly regulated and is of interest as a drug target |CITS: [18003612]|.
/
/In enteric bacteria the pyrimidine biosynthetic genes are scattered on the chromosome and may be a single transcriptional unit or part of a small operon.  They have their own regulatory mechanisms and are not regulated by a common repressor.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Pyrimidine and purine nucleotides are components of nucleic acids in all living organisms.  Although the enzymatic steps in their <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis are conserved, some differences in the enzymes exist.  For example in bacteria and plants the three steps leading from carbamoyl phosphate to orotate are catalyzed by three different proteins, while in mammals they are catalyzed by a single multifunctional CAD protein.  In plants and animals the last two steps of the pathway are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme UMP synthase, whereas bacteria express two separate proteins for this purpose (in |CITS: [8619816][12369616]| and reviewed in |CITS: [16669783]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts bicarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP), a pyrimidine ribonucleotide that can be subsequently converted to other pyrimidine ribonucleotides as shown in the link at the end of this pathway, and in the superpathway links below.
/
/The first enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, forms carbamoyl phosphate from ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia derived from L-glutamine.  Carbamoyl phosphate is both an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis and also a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids such as L-arginine and L-citrulline as shown in the pathway link, and L-canavanine in plants |CITS: [16480916]|.
/
/The next step, which is catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamylase, is the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate with L-aspartate forming <i>N</i>-carbamoyl-L-aspartate.  This is the committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis.  <i>N</i>-carbamoyl-L-aspartate, is then cyclized to (<i>S</i>)-dihydroorotate, the first intermediate that contains a pyrimidine ring.  This compound is oxidized to orotate by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.  Orotate, an aromatic pyrimidine base, is therefore formed in three steps from carbamoyl phosphate. 
/
/The final two steps, the condensation of orotate with PRPP forming the first pyrimidine nucleotide orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP), followed by the decarboylation of OMP to UMP, are carried out by the enzymes orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase.  UMP was identified in early work as an inhibitor of the first enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase |CITS: [4358555]|.
/
/In enteric bacteria the pyrimidine biosynthetic genes are scattered on the chromosome and may be a single transcriptional unit or part of a small operon.  They have their own regulatory mechanisms and are not regulated by a common repressor.

/|FRAME: PWY0-162| as shown above in the pathway links.  In addition to <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis, salvage
/pathways re-utilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can
/enter the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY0-181| and |FRAME: PWY0-163|).  These
/essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate products of these pathways are incorporated into DNA (|FRAME: DCTP| and
/|FRAME: TTP|) and RNA (|FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP|).  The <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways are
/necessary in order to supply the cell with nucleoside triphosphates for stable RNA and DNA synthesis when
/precursors are limiting.  These biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate
/and reducing power.  In <i>Escherichia coli</i> they are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene
/expression level in order to conserve resources under different growth conditions.
/
/The pyrimidine nucleotide <i>de novo</i> biosynthetic pathways derive in part from the central metabolic
/precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|.  Oxaloacetate from the |FRAME: TCA|
/gives rise to the aspartate family of amino acids and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is a precursor of both pyrimidine
/ribonucleotides and nicotinamide coenzymes (see |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  The overall pathway begins
/with the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| from bicarbonate, phosphate from ATP and nitrogen from
/glutamine.  This compound then condenses with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to
/form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| as shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY0-162| and |FRAME: PWY-5686|. 
/The overall pathway branches at |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is an intermediate in |FRAME: ARG|
/biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY|).  The activated intermediate |FRAME: PRPP| is derived from
/|FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and is a precursor in the <i>de novo</i> and salvage pathways for pyrimidine and purine
/nucleotides, as well as in biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide coenzymes, |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP|
/(see |FRAME: PRPP-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY0-662| and |FRAME: PWY0-661|).
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here illustrates the point at which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CDP|, |FRAME: CTP|,
/|FRAME: UDP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and the
/DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed.  Deoxyribonucleotides are
/synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides, which is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme ribonucleotide reductase
/that carries out reduction at the C2' position.  This enzyme has a central role in DNA replication and repair. 
/In <i>E. coli</i> this ribo- to deoxyribo- conversion is catalyzed by aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, or
/anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase.  Electrons for these reductions are derived
/from |FRAME: NADPH| and are transferred via |FRAME: Red-Thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|,
/or |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins|.
/
/The ribonucleotide reductase product of genes |FRAME: EG10660| and |FRAME: EG10661| functions aerobically
/and under microaerophilic conditions.  A normally cryptic enzyme encoded by genes |FRAME: EG20257|
/and |FRAME: EG12381| cannot support aerobic, or microaerophilic growth in a <i>nrdAB</i> deletion mutant. 
/However, it supports aerobic growth in such a mutant when genes <i>nrdHIEF</i> are overexpressed on a
/plasmid |CITS: [16771665]|.  It has been speculated that this additional aerobic enzyme may enhance
/ribonucleotide reductase activity under conditions of oxidative stress.  The anaerobic enzyme is encoded by
/gene |FRAME: EG11417| which functions in a multienzyme complex with the products of genes |FRAME: G812|
/and |FRAME: EG10628|.  Pathways for the reduction of these reductase enzymes have also been studied
/|CITS: [16771665]|.
/
/The major pathway for the aerobic, <i>de novo</i> formation of the intermediate |FRAME: DUMP|, the immediate
/precursor of thymine-containing nucleotides, is via phosphorylation of |FRAME: DCDP|
/to |FRAME: DCTP| and deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUTP| which is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: DUMP|. 
/This pathway supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.  Most of the remainder is presumed to
/be formed from |FRAME: DUDP|, as shown.  In <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: EG11418|, |FRAME: EG10219| mutants, an
/alternate <i>de novo</i> deoxycytidine pathway to |FRAME: DUMP| is used that relies on salvage enzymes
/|CITS: [17827303]|.  Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of
/|FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by
/|FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX|.  Two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is
/catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the product
/of gene |FRAME: EG10650| which also catalyzes two preceding reactions.

COMMENT - The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (UTP and CTP) can be synthesized <i>de novo</i> (see
/|FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing pyrimidines (uracil and cytosine) or their nucleosides (uridine and
/cytidine) that might be present in the environment.  Any of these four compounds can serve as a total
/source of pyrimidine for both ribonucleoside triphosphates and subsequently for both deoxyribonucleoside
/triphosphates as well (see |FRAME: PWY0-166|).  Exogenously supplied cytosine is rapidly converted to
/uracil and subsequently converted to UMP which flows through a portion of the <i>de novo</i> pyrimidine
/biosynthesis pathway to UTP and CTP. 
/
/Although enzymes are present in <i>E. coli</i> that are capable of converting cytidine directly to CTP, in
/fact exogenously supplied cytidine does not flow through this pathway.  Instead, a very active cytidine
/deaminase converts it rapidly to uridine, which then flows to UTP and then to CTP.  The existence of the
/direct pathway from cytidine to CTP is an accident of the lack of specificity of uridine kinase. 
/Exogenously supplied cytidine will flow directly to CTP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation.  A
/CMP-specific kinase is present in <i>E. coli</i>.  Its purpose is not to utilize externally supplied cytosine. 
/Instead, it is to recover CMP generated intracellularly by the hydrolytic turnover of RNA.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/<i>De novo</i> biosynthesis of purines starts with the synthesis of IMP which can be converted to all other purines.  In <i>E. coli</i> IMP is synthesized in a total of 11 enzymatic reactions in which the purine ring is formed by stepwise addition of small molecules to 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose-1-phosphate (PRPP).  The first five reactions are shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY-6121| and |FRAME: PWY-6122| which illustrate the alternative use of two phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferases encoded by <i>purN</i> and  <i>purT</i>.  The last six reactions leading to IMP are shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6123|.  IMP can then be converted to guanosine nucleotides as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6125|, or adenosine nucleotides as shown in this pathway.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/IMP is converted to adenylo-succinate by the enzyme |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCCINATE-SYN-DIMER| (PurA) and the latter compound is converted to the first adenosine nucleotide, AMP, by the |FRAME: AMPSYN-ENZRXN| activity of PurB.
/
/AMP is then converted to ADP and subsequently to ATP.  The AMP to ADP conversion is catalyzed by |FRAME: ADENYL-KIN-MONOMER|, a specific nucleoside monophosphate kinase.  Numerous reactions can convert ADP to ATP and they can be found in multiple pathways including fueling pathways such as anaerobic respiration, TCA-aerobic respiration, fermentation, and glycolysis.  However, a major source for this conversion is the |FRAME: ATPSYN-CPLX| complex, which is membrane bound and utilizes a proton gradient across membranes to phosphorylate ADP.  This is the reaction depicted in this pathway.
/
/ADP can also be converted to the deoxy form dADP by either |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX| (NrdAB) or |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTII-CPLX| (NrdEF).  dADP is converted to dATP by |FRAME: NUCLEOSIDE-DIP-KIN-CPLX| (Ndk).  Under strictly anaerobic conditions, the |FRAME: ENZRXN0-805| activity of the class III ribonucleotide reductase NrdD can convert ATP to its deoxy form.
/
/In bacteria, genetic studies have indicated that the majority of <i>de novo</i> purine biosynthetic genes are unlinked, but may act as a single unit of regulation controlled by the PurR repressor protein |CITS:[2404765]|.

/The conversion of IMP to GMP is catalyzed by the consecutive action of |FRAME: IMP-DEHYDROG-CPLX| and |FRAME: GMP-SYN-CPLX| encoded by <i>guaB</i> and <i>guaA</i>, respectively.  The former enzyme is the first committed step in GMP synthesis.

The purine biosynthetic pathway is also regulated by the products GMP and AMP which allosterically inhibit the first enzyme of the pathway |FRAME: PRPPAMIDOTRANS-CPLX| (PurF) (as shown in the pathway links). 
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> IMP is synthesized from 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole (AIR) in six steps, catalyzed by five enzymes.  The first four steps are catalyzed by |FRAME: PURK-CPLX| (PurK), |FRAME: PURE-CPLX| (PurE), |FRAME: SAICARSYN-CPLX| (PurC), and |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (PurB), respectively.  The last two steps are catalyzed by a single, bifunctional, folate-dependent enzyme, |FRAME: AICARTRANSIMPCYCLO-CPLX| (PurH).
/
/
/In contrast to higher eukaryotes in which 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole (AIR) is directly carboxylated to 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate (CAIR) by a single enzyme, in bacteria and yeast AIR is converted to CAIR in two steps.  In <i>E. coli</i> the <i>N<sup>5</sup></i> of AIR is carboxylated to form the unstable intermediate <i>N<sup>5</sup></i>-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (<i>N<sup>5</sup></i>-CAIR) by PurK and then <i>N<sup>5</sup></i>-CAIR is converted to CAIR by PurE |CITS: [8117684 ][19053251]|.
/
/In the next reaction PurC catalyzes the ligation of the carboxylate group of CAIR to the amino group of aspartate to form 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole (SAICAR).  This amino group becomes the N(1) nitrogen atom of the final purine base.  The remaining portion of the aspartate molecule is eliminated in the next reaction as fumarate, with the formation of aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) catalyzed by PurB.  PurB is an enzyme with dual substrate specificity which also catalyzes an analogous reaction in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6126|.  In the penultimate reaction a formyl group is transferred to AICAR to form phosphoribosyl-formamido-carboxamide (FAICAR), catalyzed by the bifunctional PurH which also catalyzes cyclization of FAICAR to IMP with elimination of water |CITS: [18712276]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Purine bases consist of a six-membered and a five-membered nitrogen-containing rings fused together. There are four purine bases, namely |FRAME: ADENINE|, |FRAME: GUANINE|, |FRAME: HYPOXANTHINE| and |FRAME: XANTHINE|. Purine nucleotides may be synthesized <i>de novo</i> from simpler precursors, or they may be derived from exogenous purine nucleosides and bases by the salvage pathways.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i>, the salvage pathways collect exogenous, preformed bases and nucleosides for nucleotide synthesis, reutilize bases and nucleosides produced endogenously from nucleotide turnover, and make available the pentose moieties of exogenous nucleosides as sources of carbon. When free bases or nucleosides present in the growth medium are salvaged, the contribution from the <i>de novo</i> pathways to nucleotide synthesis is greatly suppressed.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Guanosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i> as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6125|. In that route GMP is synthesized via IMP and XMP, which is converted to GMP by the action of GMP synthetase, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate. Note that the free base guanine or the ribonucleoside guanosine are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle guanosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathway is responsible for degradation of the nucleotides to the nucleoside guanosine and the base guanine, which can be further degraded via xanthine and urate (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6608|).  In some organisms urate is catabolized to basic building blocks (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5691|). However, both guanosine and guanine can be salvaged by certain enzymes and converted back to their nucleotide form as shown in this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6620|.  In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the latter pathway is the major salvage route.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-322| encoded by <i>E. coli</i> gene <i>gsk</i> can phosphorylate guanosine directly to GMP, which can enter the |FRAME: PWY-6125| pathway as indicated by the pathway link. Even though genes encoding this enzyme have been identified only in bacteria and archaea |CITS: [10879466]|, this activity has also been reported for some plants |CITS: [Combes89]|. Either this pathway, or pathway |FRAME: PWY-6620|, enables <i>E. coli</i> to salvage the degradation products of guanosine nucleotides and recycle them back to nucleotide form.
/
/Studies using purified <i>E. coli</i> |FRAME: CPLX0-322| showed that guanosine is the physiological substrate although the enzyme can also utilize inosine.  End product inhibition by GMP was demonstrated.  The data suggested that guanosine kinase may be a regulatory enzyme that has a role in modulating nucleotide levels |CITS: [10879466]|.

COMMENT - Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i>. In that route |FRAME: AMP| (AMP) is synthesized via |FRAME: IMP| (IMP) and |FRAME: ADENYLOSUCC| , which is converted to AMP by the action of
/|FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|). Note that the free base |FRAME: ADENINE| or the ribonucleoside |FRAME: ADENOSINE| are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of the nucleotides to the nucleoside (|FRAME: ADENOSINE|) and  free base form (|FRAME: ADENINE|), and further degradation to compounds that can be catabolized to basic building blocks (for example, see |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|).
/
/However, both |FRAME: ADENOSINE| and |FRAME: ADENINE| can be salvaged by certain enzymes, and be converted back to nucleotide form.
/
/The enzyme |FRAME: DEOD-CPLX "purine phosphorylase (DeoD)"| (EC 2.4.2.1) cleaves |FRAME: ADENOSINE| to |FRAME: ADENINE| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-1P|, while a second enzyme, such as |FRAME: ADENPRIBOSYLTRAN-CPLX|, can utilize |FRAME: PRPP| to convert the free base to the mononucleotide |FRAME: AMP|.
/
/Another route from |FRAME: ADENOSINE| to |FRAME: AMP| is acheived in a single step by the enzyme |FRAME: HS08097-MONOMER| (EC 2.7.1.20). The enzyme has been described in bacteria, yeast, plants and animals |CITS: [5092557][8577746][11115893][16511094][17869216][19329636]|.

COMMON-NAME - guanine and guanosine salvage I
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Guanosine nucleotides can be synthesized <i>de novo</i> as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6125|. In that route GMP is synthesized via IMP and XMP, which is converted to GMP by the action of GMP synthetase, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate. Note that the free base guanine or the ribonucleoside guanosine are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> biosynthesis pathway.
/
/Many organisms can also recycle guanosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathway is responsible for degradation of the nucleotides to the nucleoside guanosine and the base guanine, which can be further degraded via xanthine and urate (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6608|).  In some organisms urate is catabolized to basic building blocks (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5691|). However, both guanosine and guanine can be salvaged by certain enzymes and converted back to their nucleotide form as shown in this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6618|.  In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the pathway shown here is the major salvage route.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> phosphorolytic cleavage of the <i>N</i>-glycosyl bond of of purine ribonucleosides or deoxyribonucleosides, as shown here for guanosine, is catalyzed by the purine nucleoside phosphorylases encoded by genes <i>deoD</i> and <i>xapA</i>. The released purine base, in this case guanine, is subsequently converted to a nucleotide, in this case GMP, by the action of phosphoribosyltransferases encoded by genes <i>gpt</i> and <i>hpt</i>.
/
/DeoD is the classical purine nucleoside phosphorylase I. It utilizes guanosine, adenosine, or inosine (or their corresponding deoxyribonucleosides) as substrate. Synthesis of this enzyme is induced in the presence of deoxyribonucleosides, inosine, or guanosine in the growth medium.  As shown here it cleaves guanosine to guanine and &alpha;-D-ribose-1-phosphate. XapA (xanthosine phosphorylase) cleaves 6-oxopurine ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides and is induced after exposure of cells to xanthosine in the medium |CITS: [7007809]|.
/
/In the second step, the two phosphoribosyltransferases Hpt and Gpt salvage 6-oxopurine bases.  Gpt and Hpt utilize 5-phospho-&alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate to convert the free base guanine to the mononucleotide GMP. As shown in <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, together these enzymes can rescue all 6-oxopurine bases |CITS: [4563984]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized either <i>de novo</i>, or by recycling of the free base adenine and the ribonucleoside adenosine.  In the <i>de novo</i> route AMP is synthesized via IMP and adenylo-succinate, which is converted to AMP by the action of |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|).  Note that adenine and adenosine are not produced via the <i>de novo</i> pathway.
/
/However, the distinction between nucleoside degradation and recycling via salvage pathways is not always straightforward.  Salvage pathways start with the nucleoside or free base forms and lead to the formation of the nucleotide forms.  Degradation pathways usually start with the nucleotide form and end with compounds such as urate, that may lead to production of energy and provision of nitrogen and carbon.
/
/Many organisms including <i>E. coli</i> can recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways.  In <i>E. coli</i> the degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of nucleotides (AMP) to nucleosides (adenosine) (see pathway |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|) and free bases (adenine) (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6617|).  In the former pathway, adenosine is further degraded to urate.  Although radiolabeled carbon experiments have indicated the presence of a uricase activity that catalyzes the degradation of urate to <i>S</i>-allantoin, no such enzyme has been detected in <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [10986234]|.  Three variants of salvage pathways for adenosine and adenine found in <i>E. coli</i> are shown in this pathway, pathway |FRAME: PWY-6609| and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6611|.
/
/Purine salvage pathways also ensure that <i>E. coli</i> mutants that are unable to synthesize the intermediate IMP by the <i>de novo</i> pathways can obtain any purine bases or purine nucleosides that are present in the growth medium.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/This pathway shares some steps with pathway |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|.  It starts with adenine and ends with IMP, which is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of adenosine and guanosine nucleotides as shown in the pathway links.  In contrast, the degradation pathway starts with the nucleotide form (AMP) and ends with urate (see above).  The  phosphorylases <i>deoD</i> and <i>xapA</i> constitute the major route for salvage of the purine moieties of both ribonucleotides and deoxyribonucleotides, which are subsequently converted to nucleotide form by phosphoribosyltransferase reactions.
/
/As indicated in the links, exogenous adenine can be transported into the cell by the product of <i>yieG</i> (<i>purP</i>) (see |FRAME: EG11724-MONOMER|), or it can enter via a low-affinity uptake process |CITS: [8165228]|.  It may also be produced intracellularly by the action of |FRAME: AMP-NUCLEOSID-CPLX| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6617|).

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The nucleotides ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism |CITS: [18039766] [18430135]|.  In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|.
/
/Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.  It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence.  Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of ppGpp analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new <i>in vitro</i> synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for ppGpp.  Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered.  Even in the well-studied <i>Escherichia coli</i> many details of ppGpp action remain to be elucidated.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.
/
/In the <i>E. coli</i> stringent response transcription, translation and DNA replication are affected by (p)ppGpp levels.  Transcription is redirected from genes related to growth to genes involved in survival under starvation and stress conditions.  The regulation of transcription by (p)ppGpp occurs at the transcription initiation stage and affects promoter use.  However, the mechanism remains unclear and direct and indirect models for regulation have been proposed.  It has been shown that ppGpp and a cofactor protein DksA bind to RNA polymerase and modulate its activity at promoters |CITS: [15294157] [15899978]|, although the exact ppGpp binding site(s) responsible for regulation are undefined |CITS: [18272182]|.  Transcription of many &sigma;<sup>70</sup>-dependent genes and genes dependent upon alternative sigma factors is negatively or positively regulated by ppGpp.  In direct models for regulation, ppGpp affects the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction via stabilization, or destabilization of the RNA polymerase-promoter open complex.  Indirect models include changes in the availability of RNA polymerase, and a role for ppGpp in regulating differential binding of sigma factors to core RNA polymerase.  Transcriptional alterations resulting from these mechanisms include repression of tRNA and rRNA synthesis (a key event in limiting the growth rate), induction of stress response factors, and induction of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport.  Reviewed in |CITS: [16554711] [15686546] [18359660]|.
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> the regulation of translation by (p)ppGpp involves its repression of transcription of rRNA, tRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as its interaction with initiation factor IF2 and possibly with elongation factors.  The regulation of DNA replication by (p)ppGpp in <i>E. coli</i> involves inhibition of the initiation step.  The demonstration that the <i>E. coli</i> DnaG primase is inhibited by ppGpp <i>in vitro</i> also suggests inhibition of the elongation step |CITS: [19945481]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18359660]|.
/
/In <i>Escherichia coli</i> the products of genes <i>relA</i> and <i>spoT</i> have prominent roles in (p)ppGpp metabolism.  This was shown by the absence of ppGpp in <i>relA</i>/<i>spoT</i> null mutants under stringent conditions |CITS: [2005134]|.  RelA functions as a synthetase and SpoT mainly as a hydrolase, although it also has synthetase activity.  Regulation of these opposing activities is critical for the ability of bacteria to respond to nutritional stress and to avoid a futile cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp..  Homologous variants of the RelA and SpoT genes encoding Rsh proteins (Rel Spo homologs) are found in some bacteria and plants.  The &beta;- and &gamma;-proteobacteria have proteins homologous to RelA and SpoT, while most other bacteria have a bifunctional protein designated Rel.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629]|.
/
/Experiments have shown that regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by RelA in response to amino acid starvation occurs at the level of translation on the ribosome.  Ribosome-associated RelA produces ppGpp in response to the presence of uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal A-site which results in a stalled ribosome.  Regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by SpoT is less well understood, but involves sensing other sources of nutrient stress, such as a limitation in fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [17078815]|.  SpoT also senses phosphate starvation |CITS: [17640895]| and iron limitation |CITS: [15853883]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [16554711]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The pathway shown here for the biosynthesis and metabolism of (p)ppGpp is based upon that shown in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see reference below) except as noted.  Early kinetic studies established the overall pathway of ppGpp metabolism.  The first product of the stringent response to amino acid starvation is pppGpp which is quickly converted to the more stable compound ppGpp.  ppGpp is then hydrolyzed to GDP |CITS: [782536] [321933]|.  A role for a kinase in converting GDP back to GTP to complete a cycle was proposed early (in |CITS: [321933] [365225]|) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, the product of gene <i>ndk</i>, was suggested as a likely candidate.  This was supported by mutant studies in <i>Salmonella enterica</i> serovar Typhimurium (<i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>) although there is no direct evidence for a unique effect of Ndk on (p)ppGpp levels in <i>E. coli</i> or <i>S. typhimurium</i> (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).
/
/RelA can catalyze the conversion of both GTP to pppGpp, and GDP to ppGpp with similar <i>S</i><sub>0.5</sub> values derived from the Hill equation.  These values are well below the intracellular pool concentrations of GTP and ATP, but are similar to the intracellular pool concentration of GDP |CITS: [3015258]|.  Therefore pppGpp is probably the main RelA product, although both reactions are shown here (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  In addition to a synthetase (PSI) domain, RelA also contains an inactive hydrolase domain (in |CITS: [18454629]|).  RelA is responsible for ppGpp synthesis during the stringent response to amino acid starvation.
/
/<i>In vivo</i> pppGpp is rapidly converted to ppGpp by Gpp (reviewed in |CITS: [15590778]|).  It is the major route of pppGpp degradation, although minor routes via enzymes with similar activity may also exist (Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).
/
/SpoT is a bifunctional enzyme with both a hydrolase activity and a weak synthetase activity (designated PSII) |CITS: [2005135] [8730877]|.  The SpoT ppGpp hydrolase activity is inhibited under conditions of physiological stress and has a major role in ppGpp degradation.  The role of the SpoT synthetase (PSII) activity is less clear.  It has been proposed to have a role in maintaining the basal level of ppGpp during exponential growth (in |CITS: [8648647]|).  SpoT also has pppGpp hydrolase activity |CITS: [365225]| and possibly pppGpp synthetase activity.  The putative SpoT pppGpp synthetase activity is based on mutant phenotype.  In &Delta;<i>relA</i>/&Delta;<i>gpp</i> mutants starved for glucose pppGpp accumulates which suggests phosphoryl group transfer to GTP as well as GDP, although the phsophoryl donor is not known (cited as unpublished data in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  This reaction is not shown here.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Iron is an essential trace element. In the presence of oxygen, ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) which forms insoluble compounds that are not available to bacteria. As a result, the level of physiologically available iron can drop to low levels and become growth-limiting. To survive, many bacteria evolved specialized transport systems for low molecular weight iron chelating compounds called siderophores which form complexes with Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Amino acid conjugates of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate make up a major class of siderophores, including enterobactin, bacillibactin and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylglycine.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> produces only one siderophore, enterobactin which is a cyclic triester of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine. It is transported by the |FRAME: EG10293-MONOMER| which imports Fe3<sup>+</sup> chelated to enterobactin into the cell. Enterobactin biosynthesis in unnecessary under anaerobic conditions when iron is in the soluble Fe<sup>2+</sup> form.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/As indicated in the first the pathway link, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is synthesized from chorismate via isochorismate and 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoate. Chorismate is a key intermediate and branch point in the biosynthesis of many aromatic compounds. As shown in the second pathway link, three molecules of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate are combined with three molecules of L-serine by the |FRAME: ENTMULTI-CPLX| to form enterobactin. Isochorismate is both a precursor of enterobactin via isochorismate synthase EntC, and a precursor of menaquinol-8 via isochorismate synthase MenF. Menaquinol-8 is required under anaerobic conditions (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5837| and subsequent pathway links).
/
/The biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate from chorismate is catalyzed by three enzymes EntC, EntB, and EntA. EntC catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate. The N-terminal isochorismate lyase domain of EntB hydrolyzes the pyruvate group of isochorismate to produce 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. The conversion of this latter compound to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is catalyzed by the EntA dehydrogenase.
/
/Gene <i>ryhB</i> encodes a small RNA that promotes enterobactin biosynthesis via posttranscriptional mechanisms. It is required for normal expression of the <i>entCEBAH</i> transcription unit, and it also represses translation of the <i>cysE</i> encoded |FRAME: CPLX0-237| thereby allowing L-serine to be used in enterobactin biosynthesis |CITS: [20696910]|.

/4-hydroxybenzoate (<i>p</i>-hydroxybenzoate) is a precursor of the important electron carrier ubiquinone (see |FRAME: Ubiquinones|). In bacteria and fungi 4-hydroxybenzoate is produced from chorismate by the enzyme |FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/The name trehalose was introduced in 1858 to describe a main constituent of shells that are secreted by various insects on tree leaves in the middle east.  These shells were often dried and used as a sweetening agent, and are believed to be related to the biblical Manna, the food supplied to the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness of Arabia.  One variety of these shells, produced by the beetles <i>Larinus maculatus</i> and <i>Larinus nidificans</i>, was called "trehala manna", and the sugar extracted from it was named trehalique glucose, or trehalose |CITS: [12065209]|.  In fact, trehalose is a disaccharide that is ubiquitous in the biosphere.  It consists of two subunits of glucose bound by an &alpha;:1-1 linkage (&alpha;-D-glucopyranosil &alpha;-D-glucopyranoside) and is thus nonreducing.  Trehalose has been isolated and characterized from many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, insects and mammals |CITS: [11081789]| (and original references described therein). 
/
/In addition to being nonreducing, trehalose possesses several unique properties, including high hydrophilicity, chemical stability, nonhygroscopic glass formation and no internal hydrogen bond formation.  The combination of these features explains the principal role of trehalose as a stress metabolite.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/Under conditions of elevated osmotic strength, <i>E. coli</i> can regulate the osmotic strength of the cytoplasm by accumulating K<sup>+</sup> ions and some organic molecules, commonly called osmoprotectants or compatible solutes.  The preferred osmoprotectant of <i>E. coli</i> is glycine betaine.  However, its synthesis relies on an external supply of proline, betaines, or choline.  When these compounds are not available, a cell can achieve a moderate level of osmotic tolerance by accumulation of glutamate and trehalose |CITS: [1825082]|.
/
/<i>E. coli</i> synthesizes and accumulates trehalose only when exposed to osmotic stress |CITS: [2883950]|.  It is synthesized from UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate via trehalose-6-phosphate, by the action of two enzymes, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase.  The genes encoding the two enzymes, <i>otsA</i> and <i>otsB</i>, are both osmotically regulated.  Transcription from these genes increases during osmotic stress |CITS: [3131312]| and when the cells enter stationary phase, and requires the stress sigma factor RpoS |CITS: [1744047]|.

/
/Under osmotic stress, <i>E. coli</i> overproduces trehalose, some of which is excreted to the periplasmic space.  Once there, it is degraded by the periplasmic trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182|).  This process was named "a futile cycle for controlling the cytoplasmic level of trehalose" |CITS: [1825082]|.

CITATIONS - 11489131:EV-EXP-IDA:3446387577:keseler
COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/Cell-to-cell communication in bacteria is accomplished through the exchange of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression as a function of cell density. Many processes benefit from community cooperation, including bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development.
/
/Cell to cell signaling through quorum sensing in bacteria occurs through three main processes LuxR-LuxI, LuxS/AI-2, and AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine.  The LuxR-LuxI process controls signaling through autoinducer 1 (AI-1) which is an <i>N</i>-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL).  It was first described in <i>Vibrio fischeri</i> as a regulator of bioluminescence.  However <i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> lack LuxI and do not synthesize AHLs, although the product of gene <i>sdiA</i> recognizes AHLs from other bacterial species.  The LuxS/AI-2 process controls both intraspecies and interspecies signaling.  It was first described as an extracellular signal produced by the marine bacterium <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> to control luciferase expression |CITS: [7984107][9990077]|.  In <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i> AI-2 activates transcription of the <i>lsr</i> operon encoding an ABC transporter, the LsrB subunit of which binds AI-2 (see |FRAME: ABC-58-CPLX|).  The AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine process involves recognition by gut commensals of autoinducer produced by self, other bacteria, or human hormones.  In <i>E. coli</i> AI-3 interacts with a membrane-bound protein QseC which is part of the QseB-QseC two component system.
/
/AI-2 production depends upon growth conditions.  Factors include nutrients, pH, osmolarity, oxygen, growth rate and stress factors.  However, its exact role in cell signaling is still controversial and there is evidence that its function may be metabolic |CITS: [16352847][16385049][16321939]|.  A role for AI-2 in pathogenesis also remains to be established although transcriptomics studies have suggested that AI-2 may have a role in the regulation of virulence in enterohemorrhagic <i>E. coli</i> |CITS: [18256823]|. The <i>E. coli</i> AI-2 network has also been the subject of different modeling approaches |CITS: [19695305][17170762]|.

/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/One of the main bacterial autoinducers is autoinducer 2 (AI-2) which mediates the quorum sensing 2 (QS-2) system.  Its biosynthesis is catalyzed by the LuxS enzyme which also participates in the SAM cycle (see |FRAME: PWY-6151|). The LuxS enzyme is found in many bacteria including <i>E. coli</i> and <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>.  Its role in AI-2 biosynthesis is suggested by the presence of the Lsr ABC transporter, the LsrB protein of which serves as the AI-2 receptor in many of these organisms |CITS: [18803868]| (see |FRAME: ABC-58-CPLX|).
/
/The precursor of AI-2 is synthesized by the enzyme <i>S</i>-ribosylhomocysteine lyase, which also catalyzes a step in the SAM cycle.  The enzyme converts <i>S</i>-ribosyl-L-homocysteine to L-homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione. Within the SAM cycle, the main product of the enzyme is L-homocysteine.  In AI-2 biosynthesis 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione is of major importance as it appears to be nonenzymatically converted in a series of chemical modifications to the mature autoinducer.
/
/The exact nature of the chemical transformations depends on the species. In <i>E. coli</i> and most pathogenic bacteria that form AI-2 the spontaneous transformations include cyclization to (2<i>R</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,4-dihydroxydihydrofuran-3-one and hydration to the final autoinducer (2<i>R</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran. This form of the autoinducer, which was first characterized from <i>Salmonella typhimurium</i>, was shown to be different from the form that was initially described from <i>Vibrio harveyi</i> (see below) and is recognized by the LsrB periplasmic binding protein |CITS: [15350213]|.
/
/Members of the order Vibrionales produce a different form of the autoinducer. In those organisms, 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione appears to form a different stereoisomer, namely (2<i>S</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,4-dihydroxydihydrofuran-3-one, which hydrates to (2<i>S</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran and forms a complex with a borate ion to form (2<i>S</i>,4<i>S</i>)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran-borate |CITS: [11823863][18803868]|,  (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-6154|). The mechanism that controls which stereoisomer is formed is still not understood.

COMMENT - |FRAME: 7-Deazapurines "7-Deazapurines"| are compounds that contain pyrrolopyrimidine functional groups (similar to purines, but lackinging one of the nitrogens in the pentameric ring).  These compounds form a structurally diverse class of nucleoside analogues that often possess antibiotic, antineoplastic, or antiviral activities.
/
/An important |FRAME: 7-Deazapurines "7-deazapurine"| compound is |FRAME: CPD-13053|, a modified nucleoside that is present in certain tRNAs in bacteria and most eukaryotes (with the exception of mycoplasmas and yeast), but not in the archaea |CITS: [12697167]|.  The pathway describing the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-13053| can be found at |FRAME: PWY-6700|.
/
/The biosynthesis of all 7-deazapurines proceeds via the common intermediate |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, which is produced in four steps from the nucleotide |FRAME:GTP|.  The pathway starts with the conversion of GTP to |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3| by |FRAME: FOLE-CPLX|, an enzyme that is also involved in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: THF|.  |FRAME: DIHYDRONEOPTERIN-P3| is converted to |FRAME: CPD0-1699| by the action of |FRAME: G7431-MONOMER|.  
/
/This intermediate is converted to |FRAME: CPD-13043| by an unusual transformation catalyzed by |FRAME: BSU13740-MONOMER| (|FRAME: BSU13740|), a member of the radical SAM enzyme superfamily.  The corresponding <i>E. coli</i> enzyme has not yet been identified, but an ortholog, |FRAME: G7443|, exists.
/
/Finally, the carboxylate moiety of |FRAME: CPD-13043| is converted to a nitrile in an ATP-dependent reaction in which ammonia serves as the nitrogen source.  The reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: G6245-MONOMER|, generating the final product, |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE| |CITS: [19354300]|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/L-fucose is an important monosaccharide found in a diverse array of organisms. It is a carbohydrate component of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, mammalian and plant glycoproteins and various plant cell wall polysaccharides. Fucosylation is performed by fucosyltransferases which require the activated form GDP-L-fucose as the donor substrate. The formation of GDP-L-fucose occurs via two routes, a <i>de novo</i> synthesis route from GDP-&alpha;-D-mannose (this pathway), and a eukaryotic salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-fucose from free L-fucose (see |FRAME:PWY-6|).  
/
/The <i>de novo</i> synthesis of GDP-L-fucose from GDP-D-mannose comprises three catalytic steps: a 4,6-dehydration, a 3,5-epimerization, and a 4-reduction. The first reaction step is catalyzed by |FRAME: GDPMANDEHYDRA-CPLX|, which involves the formation of the intermediate GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose. This compound is also a common intermediate in the synthesis of other bacterial deoxyhexoses derived from GDP-D-mannose (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: PWY-5738| |FRAME: PWY-5739| |FRAME: GDPRHAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5740|). In bacteria (including <i>E. coli</i>), fungi, plants and humans, the second and third reactions have been shown to be catalyzed by a single bifunctional polypeptide, GDP-fucose synthase |CITS:[12881408][9525924][8910301][20035716]|.
/
/In the Enterobacteriaceae colanic acid (M antigen) is a polyanionic extracellular heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with D-glucose, L-fucose, D-galactose, and D-glucuronate sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with <i>O</i>-acetyl and pyruvate side chains |CITS: [4902806 ][4941627]|. The sugars must be activated in the form of nucleotide sugars (such as |FRAME: GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE|) before their assembly |CITS: [8759852] [8763957]| (see pathway COLANSYN-PWY). Colanic acid biosynthesis has been linked to a cluster of 19 <i>wca</i> genes that includes <i>wcaG</i> (<i>fcl</i>) encoding GDP-fucose synthase |CITS:[8759852][9473059]|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/L-fucose is biosynthesized as the sugar nucleotide GDP-L-fucose. Its biosynthesis from GDP-D-mannose begins with dehydration of this compound to GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose by the product of gene <i>gmd</i>. Then the bifunctional GDP-fucose synthase catalyzes the two-step (epimerase/reductase) synthesis of GDP-fucose from GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose via a GDP-4-dehydro-6-L-deoxygalactose intermediate |CITS: [9473059]|. The overall reaction is defined by EC 1.1.1.271 and is carried out at a single active site on the enzyme |CITS: [19053199]|.
/
/This pathway requires NADPH as a reducing cofactor. Overexpression of endogenous NADPH-regenerating enzymes in recombinant <i>E. coli</i> increased GDP-L-fucose production under optimized conditions |CITS: [21538115]|. In another study, overexpression of |FRAME: CPLX0-322| encoded by gene <i>gsk</i> led to a significant improvement of GDP-L-fucose production. This was attributed to the increased level of intracellular GMP as a source of GTP which is required for this pathway (as shown in the pathway link to |FRAME: PWY-5659|) |CITS: [22159740]|.

COMMENT - |FRAME: KDO| (KDO) is a component of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS).  The majority of Gram-negative bacteria LPS contain at least one 2-keto 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate molecule.
/
/This pathway starts with the isomerization of |FRAME: RIBULOSE-5P| to |FRAME: ARABINOSE-5P|, followed by its conversion to |FRAME: KDO-8P| (KDOP), which is catalyzed by a family of enzymes called |FRAME: KDO-8PSYNTH-CPLX| (KDOPS).  The bacterial KDOPSs have been grouped in two classes, and plant KDOPSs belong to a third class |CITS: [15070398]|.
/
/In the next step the phosphate group is removed from |FRAME: KDO-8P|, generating KDO.  The last step of the pathway is the activation of KDO to |FRAME: CMP-KDO|.

COMMENT - <b>General Background</b>
/
/In <i>E. coli</i> K-12 GDP-alpha-D-mannose is a precursor for the biosynthesis of GDP-L-fucose, as indicated in the pathway link. GDP-L-fucose is the nucleotide-activated form of L-fucose, a monosaccharide constituent of colanic acid. In the Enterobacteriaceae colanic acid (M antigen) is a polyanionic extracellular heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with D-glucose, L-fucose, D-galactose, and D-glucuronate sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with <i>O</i>-acetyl and pyruvate side chains |CITS: [4902806 ][4941627]| (see pathway |FRAME: COLANSYN-PWY|). 
/
/In other bacteria, GDP-alpha-D-mannose is a precursor or participant in the synthesis of deoxyhexoses, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides and organic solutes. In eukaryotes GDP-alpha-D-mannose is a key substrate in glycoconjugate formation and is a precursor for the biosynthesis of important compounds. Examples of such pathways are listed in MetaCyc under compound |FRAME: GDP-MANNOSE|.
/
/<b>About This Pathway</b>
/
/The first two enzymes in the pathway catalyze isomerizations that interconvert phosphorylated aldohexoses (&beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate, D-mannose-6-phosphate) and phosphorylated ketohexoses (D-fructose-6-phosphate). The reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: MANNPISOM-MONOMER| that produces D-mannose-6-phosphate is the first committed step in the biosynthesis of the activated mannose donor GDP-&alpha;-D-mannose. D-mannose-6-phosphate is then converted to GDP-D-mannose by the action of phosphomannomutase and mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase |CITS: [GaoIntJMassSpec05][8759852]|.
/
/Genetically engineered variants of this pathway in <i>E. coli</i> have been reported and are potentially useful in the production of mannosylglycerate |CITS: [12514000]| and fucosyloligosaccharides |CITS: [21293904]|.
