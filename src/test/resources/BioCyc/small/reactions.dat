UNIQUE-ID - RXN0-5267
TYPES - Small-Molecule-Reactions
TYPES - Transport-Reactions
COMMENT - This is a special transport reaction, which does not occur on its own.  Instead, it can be used as
/a component for composing composite electron transport reactions, when there is a vectoral
/proton transport component.
